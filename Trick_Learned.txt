Trick 1 :
Problem Statement : Suppose have many .java files like Test1.java, test2.java,Test3.java
We need to segregate the .class files in separate folder

Solution : Run the javac command as follows
	1. Create a folder in the directory using mkdir
		mkdir ClassFiles
	2. javac -classpath ClassFiles Test1.java test2.java Test3.java
	3. Running this command creates all the .class files in ClassFiles folder

Trick 2 :
problem Statement : We have created the ClassFiles Folder and now want to run all the class files in the same line

Solution :
	java -classpath ClassFiles Test1 & test2 & Test3
	where & is the concat operatoe at command line to run multiple commands


Trick 3 :
problem Statement : Suppose we want to see which method has been executed like below program

public class Test1 {
	public void isPrime(){
	System.out.println("isprime executed");
	}
}
Here we are giving the method name as hard coded. how to resolve this ?

Solution :
 String name = new Object(){}.getClass().getEnclosingMethod().getName();
 Now the program becomes :
 Public class Test1 {
 	public void isPrime(){
	String name = new Object(){}.getClass().getEnclosingMethod().getName();
	System.out.println("the method name is :"+name);
	}
}
